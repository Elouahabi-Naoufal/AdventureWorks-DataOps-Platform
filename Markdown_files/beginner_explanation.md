# AdventureWorks Project - Beginner's Guide

## What is this project? 🤔

Think of this like **building a smart assistant for a bike company** (AdventureWorks) that automatically:
- Counts how much money they made each day
- Tells them when they're running out of bikes to sell
- Shows which customers buy the most
- Warns them about problems in their data

## What is Airflow? 🌪️

**Airflow = A Robot Butler** that runs tasks automatically:
- Every day at 9 AM: "Count today's sales"
- Every Monday: "Check employee information" 
- When stock is low: "Send alert email"

Instead of you manually running these tasks, Airflow does it for you!

## What is a DAG? 📋

**DAG = A To-Do List for the Robot**

Example DAG (like a recipe):
1. Connect to database
2. Get sales data
3. Calculate total money made
4. Save results
5. Send report

## What is Snowflake? ❄️

**Snowflake = A Super Smart Filing Cabinet** in the cloud that:
- Stores all the company data (like Excel but MUCH bigger)
- Lets you ask questions like "How much did we sell last month?"
- Keeps data safe and organized

## What Tables Are We Using? 📊

Think of tables like **different folders in a filing cabinet**:

### Sales Folder 📈
- `Sales_SalesOrderHeader` = List of all orders (like receipts)
- `Sales_Customer` = Customer information (names, addresses)

### Products Folder 🚲
- `Production_Product` = List of all bikes and parts
- `Production_ProductInventory` = How many of each item we have

### People Folder 👥
- `Person_Person` = Customer details (names, emails)
- `HumanResources_Employee` = Employee information

## What We've Built So Far ✅

### 1. Setup DAG
**What it does**: Fills the database with sample data (like putting files in the filing cabinet)
**When it runs**: Once, manually

### 2. Sales Analytics DAG
**What it does**: 
- Counts how much money we made
- Finds best-selling products
- Shows sales by region
**When it runs**: Every day

### 3. Inventory DAG
**What it does**:
- Checks how many bikes we have left
- Warns when running low on stock
**When it runs**: Every morning at 6 AM

### 4. HR DAG
**What it does**:
- Counts employees
- Shows salary information
- Finds who might get promoted
**When it runs**: Every Monday

### 5. Customer DAG
**What it does**:
- Groups customers (VIP, regular, new)
- Finds what products sell together
- Suggests marketing ideas
**When it runs**: Every day at 10 AM

## What's Missing? ❌

### 1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
**Simple explanation**: "How much money will this customer spend with us over their lifetime?"
**Why important**: Know which customers are most valuable

### 2. Monthly Financial Reports
**Simple explanation**: "How much profit did we make this month?"
**Why important**: Track business performance

### 3. Data Quality Checks
**Simple explanation**: "Are there any mistakes in our data?"
**Why important**: Bad data = bad decisions

### 4. Marketing Campaign Analysis
**Simple explanation**: "Did our sale/promotion actually work?"
**Why important**: Don't waste money on bad marketing

## How Does It All Work Together? 🔄

```
1. Real bike company data → 2. Snowflake database → 3. Airflow processes it → 4. Reports & alerts
```

**Example Day**:
- 6 AM: Check inventory (Airflow runs automatically)
- 9 AM: Calculate yesterday's sales (Airflow runs automatically)  
- 10 AM: Analyze customer behavior (Airflow runs automatically)
- If stock low: Send email alert (Airflow sends automatically)

## Why Is This Useful? 💡

**Before**: Someone manually checks sales, inventory, customers every day (boring, slow, mistakes)
**After**: Robot does it automatically, faster, no mistakes, you focus on important decisions

## Your Current Progress 📊

**What works**: 60% complete
- ✅ Database setup
- ✅ Basic sales tracking  
- ✅ Inventory monitoring
- ✅ Customer analysis

**What's missing**: 40% 
- ❌ Advanced customer analysis
- ❌ Financial reports
- ❌ Data quality checks
- ❌ Marketing analysis

## Next Steps (Simple) 🎯

1. **Learn**: Understand what you have working
2. **Test**: Run the existing DAGs and see results
3. **Expand**: Add the missing pieces one by one
4. **Improve**: Add email alerts and better reports

Think of it like building with LEGO blocks - you have the foundation, now add more pieces to make it complete!
